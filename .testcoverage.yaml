# Path to coverage profile file (output of `go test -coverprofile` command).
#
# For cases where there are many coverage profiles, such as when running
# unit tests and integration tests separately, you can combine all those
# profiles into one. In this case, the profile should have a comma-separated list
# of profile files, e.g., 'cover_unit.out,cover_integration.out'.
profile: cover.out

# (optional; but recommended to set)
# When specified reported file paths will not contain local prefix in the output.

# Holds coverage thresholds percentages, values should be in range [0-100].
threshold:
  # (optional; default 0)
  # Minimum coverage percentage required for individual files.

  # (optional; default 0)
  # Minimum coverage percentage required for each package.
  package: 80

  # (optional; default 0)
  # Minimum overall project coverage percentage required.

# override rules should be listed in order from specific to more general rules.
