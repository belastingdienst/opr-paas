# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a community project, and as such we work as hard as possible to deliver
a great experience for the latest releases of PaaS. We try as hard as we can to
resolve all your issues, but only officially support the latest two releases of
the latest two major releases.

If you run into issues on older releases, please:

- check the release notes for [Releases](https://github.com/belastingdienst/paas/releases) younger than the one you're experiencing issues with for a possibly easy fix;
- check if the issue is reproducable on the latest release;

before you issue a support request.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To make a report, send an email containing the details of the vulnerability to
paas-developers@belastingdienst.nl (an alias to a private mailing list containing
just the maintainers of the project).

Private disclosure of a potential vulnerability is important.

The maintainers will reply to acknowledge the report, and decide whether to keep
it private or publicly disclose it.

PaaS relies on the [GitHub infrastructure](https://github.com/belastingdienst/paas/security) to manage security advisories and manage vulnerabilities.
