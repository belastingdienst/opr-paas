# Security Policy

The Dutch Tax Office (Dutch: Belastingdienst) takes the security of our products and services seriously.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it before sharing it with the outside world. This way, we can take measures first. This is called '[Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/standaard_functies/individuals/contact/data-leak-vulnerability-abuse-computer-systems/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure)' (CVD).

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

The Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure page on our webpage explains how to securly report your finding.

In summary:

- Send us your findings by e-mail: cvd@belastingdienst.nl
- If possible, encrypt your findings with our PGP-key on the [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/standaard_functies/individuals/contact/data-leak-vulnerability-abuse-computer-systems/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure) page.
- provide sufficient information to be able to reproduce the problem, so that we can rectify this as quickly as possible. The URL of the system affected and a description of the vulnerability are sufficient, but more information may be required for more complex vulnerabilities.
- leave your contact details so that our Security Operations Centre can contact you in order to jointly find a safe solution. Leave at least an e-mail address or telephone number.
- do not share the information regarding the security problem with other people until we have solved it.
- handle the information regarding the security problem responsibly by not performing any actions that go further than necessary to demonstrate the security problem.
- realize that any information in our systems falls under the (fiscal) duty of confidentiality and that further dissemination of the said information is a punishable offence.
