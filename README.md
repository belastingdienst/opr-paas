# opr-paas
Deze operator is bedoeld om PaaS resources te kunnen reconcilen naar namespaces, cluster quota,s ldap groepen, etc.

## IMPORTANT
The config folder is in this repo as an example only.
The actual argocd config is maintained in the opr-paas-config repo.
When changing the crd, first run `make manifests` in the root of this repo.
Then copy config/crd/bases/cpet.belastingdienst.nl_paas.yaml to the opr-paas-config repo and dsitribute with ArgoCD from there

## Description
Het idee is dat onze klanten een PaaS resource kunnen aanmaken en dat ze hiermee een applicatieomgeving kunnen (laten) creeren.
de applicatie omgeving omvat:
- argocd (namespace, quota, argocd CR
- ci (namespace, quota, tekton dingen)
- SSO (namespace, quota, keycloak)
- Grafana (namepace, quota, Grafana)

## Background information
- [build-kubernetes-operator-six-steps](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/07/build-kubernetes-operator-six-steps#setup_and_prerequisites)
- [operator sdk installation instructions](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/)

## Getting Started

### Instalation CRC
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
We run on Code Ready Containers. Instructions:
- [Red Hat](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local)

**Note** operator-sdk uses KIND instead of CRC. [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) is lower in resource consumption, but also lacking a lot we use in BD, which is shipped by default in OpenShift.

## Starting CRC
If you need to start CRC (like after a reboot, which is rerquired on BD DBO for some weird unknown reason), run `crc start` in a terminal other than iterm2 (like terminal or kitty).
After that login using the oc command as display'ed in output of `crc start`.

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
oc apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=belastingdienst/opr-paas
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=belastingdienst/opr-paas
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
For now this is a Belastingdienst Internal project.
We might Open Source it in the future, or we might not.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
