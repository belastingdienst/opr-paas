# opr-paas

## Goal

The PaaS operator delivers an opinionated 'Project as a Service' implementation where
development teams can request a 'Project as a Service' by defining a PaaS resource.

A PaaS resource is used by the operator as an input to create namespaces limited
by Cluster Resource Quota's, granting groups permissions and (together with a clusterwide
ArgoCD) creating capabilities such as:

- a PaaS specific deployment of ArgoCD (continuous deployment);
- Tekton (continuous integration);
- Grafana (observability); and
- KeyCloak (Application level Single Sign On);

A PaaS is all a team needs to hit the ground running.

## Quickstart

Deploy the operator using the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/install.yaml
```

This will create:

- a namespace called `paas-system`;
- 2 CRDs (`PaaS` and `PaasNs`);
- a service account, role, role binding, cluster role and cluster role binding for
  all permissions required by the operator;
- a viewer & an editor cluster role for PaaS and PaasNs resources;
- a configmap with all operator configuration options;
- a deployment running the operator and a deployment running an encryption service;

Feel free to change config as required.
