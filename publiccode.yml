    longDescription: >
      The PaaS operator delivers an opinionated 'Project as a Service' implementation
      where development teams can request a 'Project as a Service' by defining a PaaS
      resource.
      
      A PaaS resource is used by the operator as an input to create namespaces
      limited by Cluster Resource Quota's, granting groups permissions and (together
      with a clusterwide ArgoCD) creating capabilities such as:
      
      - a PaaS specific deployment of ArgoCD (continuous deployment);
      - Tekton (continuous integration);
      - Grafana (observability); and
      - KeyCloak (Application level Single Sign On);
      
      A PaaS is all a team needs to hit the ground running.

    shortDescription: An operator providing a multi tenancy solution which allows DevOps teams to request a context for their project, called a 'Project as a service'.
