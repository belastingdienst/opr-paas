# Paas

The whole idea is to create a Multi Tenancy solution which allows DevOps teams to request a context for their project, which we like to call a 'Project as a Service', e.a. PaaS.
The PaaS is a higher level construct, which consists of many parts, including

- namespaces
- Quotas
- authorzation
- capabilities

DevOps teams request this PaaS context by defining a PaaS resource through the k8s api.

At the very least a PaaS resource has the following defined:

- apiVersion, kind (as needs to be defined for every other k8s resource)
- metadata.name, which is unique (cluster-wide)
- spec.requestor, which is an informational field representing the requestor of this PaaS, for administrative purposes
- quota, which sets the amount of quota for all namespaces that are part of this PaaS (capability namaspaces excluded)

Additionally the following optional settings can also be defined:

- capabilities, which can be used to enable PaaS extensions such as an ArgoCD to manage all PaaS namespaces, Grafana to monitor PaaS namespaces, etc.
  More info can be found in our [capabilities](capabilities.yaml) documentation.
- spec.sshSecrets, which can be used to seed secrets that ArgoCD requires for accessing repositories. See [sshSecrets](sshsecrets.yaml) for more information.
- spec.groups, which can be used to configure authorization. See [authorization](authorization.yaml) for more information.
- spec.namespaces, which can be used to define namespaces as part of the PaaS. Alternatively, they can be manually defined as [PaasNs](paasns.yaml) resources.

## Example PaaS

```yaml
apiVersion: cpet.belastingdienst.nl/v1alpha1
kind: Paas
metadata:
  name: my-paas
spec:
  capabilities:
    # Enable argocd
    argocd:
      enabled: true
      # Bootstrap application to point to the root folder
      gitPath: .
      # Bootstrap application to point to the main branch
      gitRevision: main
      # Bootstrap application to point to this repo
      gitUrl: "ssh://git@github.com/belastingdienst/my-paas-repo.git"
    # enable grafana
    grafana:
      enabled: true
      quota:
        limits.cpu: "5"
        limits.memory: "2Gi"
```

Notes:

- labels defined on PaaS resources are copied to child resources such as PaasNs, quotas, groups, ArgoApps, ArgoProjects, etc.
  The only exception is the `app.kubernetes.io/instance`.
