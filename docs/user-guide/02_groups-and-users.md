## Groups and Users

For every Paas it is possible to define which k8s groups have permissions on resources
belonging to the Paas. It is possible to manage group membership externally, but it is
also possible to have group membership managed by the Paas operator, and even integrate
the Paas operator with a ldap sync solution based on `oc adm group sync`.

For more information on authorization, please see [Core Concepts - Authorization](../overview/core_concepts/authorization.md).

!!! Note

    When both an LDAP query and a list of users is defined, the users from the list
    are added in addition to the users from the LDAP group. If the user from the list
    was already added through the LDAP group, the user is simply ignored.

!!! example

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cpet.belastingdienst.nl/v1alpha1
    kind: Paas
    metadata:
      name: tst-tst
    spec:
      groups:
        example_group:
          query: >-
            CN=example_group,OU=example,OU=UID,DC=example,DC=nl
          users:
            - jdsmith
        second_example_group:
          users:
            - jdsmith
    ```
