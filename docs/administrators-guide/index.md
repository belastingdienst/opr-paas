## Version Support

We follow a **rollâ€‘forward support model**. Only the **latest major version** is
supported. Previous major versions are considered **end-of-life (EOL)** and do not
receive updates, security patches, or fixes.

Administrators are expected to upgrade to the latest available version to remain supported.

For detailed information about our support policy, including versioning, hotfixes,
and the noâ€‘backport rule, please refer to the [Support Policy in the Developerâ€™s Guide](../development-guide/25_support-policy.md).
