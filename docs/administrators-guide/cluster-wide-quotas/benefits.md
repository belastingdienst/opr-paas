Benefits of using CWQs
======================

The following is a good example of the benefits when implementing cluster wide
quotas. The example makes use of Tekton.

Without Cluster Wide Quotas
---------------------------

Without Cluster Wide Quotas, every Tekton namespace would be linked to a specific
cluster quota. All of these quota would add up to a considerable total quota
reservation.

However, since Tekton pipelines only rarely actually use these quotas on average
about 99% of quota would always be unused. The cluster would either be considerably
over committed or underutilized.

With Cluster Wide Quotas
------------------------

By enabling Cluster Wide Quotas, all Tekton namespaces will be linked to one
cluster wide quota.

The Cluster Wide Quota can be automatically tuned by the Paas operator, having a
minimum, maximum, default, and ratio value.

The algorithm comes down to using the largest value out of 3 different calculations:

- ratio (Paas config) * sum of all Paas resources (either defined or default);
- sum of the largest two of all Paas quotas (either defined or defaulted);
- a hard set minimum (Paas config);

Furthermore, a maximum value (Paas config) can be set to cap the quota.

Example with numbers
--------------------

Consider the following values being set in the Paas config (e.a. for `cpu.limits`):

| cluster wide config |     |                                                                                          |
|---------------------|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| min value           |  10 | When set, every cluster wide quota has at least this amount.                             |
| max value           |  20 | When set, every cluster wide quota has at most this amount.                              |
| default             |   5 | Resources can be set in Paas. When not set in Paas, this default is used.                |
| ratio               | 0,3 | Scales the sum of all quotas (all Paas'es) down to a lower value for cluster wide quota. |

Now imagine that we would have a cluster where one by one new Paas'es would be
created, with Tekton enabled, all using the default quota config.

Quota reservations would be along lines of:

| # of PAASes | CWQ disabled | Scale by ratio | Scale with min values | Scale with hardset min | Scale with min & max | Savings |

Visualized in a graph, it would look like this:

![visualized in a graph](./clusterwide_quota.png)

Once 10 Paas'es would be created:

- without CWQ's, about 50 CPU limits would be reserved for all Tekton namespaces;
- with a ratio of 0.3 only 15 would be reserved, saving 35 CPU limits;

Beyond 14 Paas'es, there would only be 20 CPU's reserved no matter how much Paas'es
would be created.
